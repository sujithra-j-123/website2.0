        <h1>HISTORY OF<br><span>PALAKKAD</span></h1>
        <p>
            Palakkad, often called the "Gateway of Kerala," is a district in Kerala, India, known for its historical and cultural significance. Its strategic location along the Palakkad Gap, a natural mountain pass in the Western Ghats, has historically facilitated trade and cultural exchange between Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Ancient references to Palakkad appear in Tamil Sangam literature, with the region initially ruled by the Chera dynasty. During medieval times, the area came under the Palakkad Rajas and was later contested by the Zamorin of Calicut and the Mysore Sultanate, including Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. The British eventually took control in the late 18th century, using Palakkad as an administrative center.
            <br><br>
            Today, Palakkad is celebrated for its lush agricultural landscape, including paddy fields and coconut groves, and its cultural diversity, shaped by both Tamil and Malayalam influences. The district is also known for landmarks like the Palakkad Fort, Kalpathy Temple, and the Malampuzha Dam, which underscores its historical and economic importance in Kerala.
